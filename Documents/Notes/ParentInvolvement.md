Summary: 

This source analyzes current and past literature to understand how parent involvement 

affects students and their success. They found that there is an overwhelming correlation 

between parent involvement in children’s learning and high student achievement. Regardless 

of age, the more involved a parent is in their child’s education, the higher that student 

scores in classes. Schools can put in place programs that involve parents in reading with 

their children, supporting their children on their homework, or tutoring them with teacher 

provided materials- regardless of program, each provides impressive results. The earlier 

parent involvement begins in the student’s education, the greater the effects will be 

long-term. Parent involvement can be further enhanced through the implementation of 

orientation/training for effective parent involvement– but it is important to note that 

this should be quick and easy training. Parent involvement also helps deal with student 

attitude and behavior.
