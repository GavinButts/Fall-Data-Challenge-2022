Summary: 

This source studies the correlation between the parent/guardian’s education

level and student achievement. As found in many studies before, these researchers

found a very consistent link between parent’s education level and student

achievement. Their studies reveal that this is a result of parents serving as

a model for learning. They also have an increased knowledge about finding

educational resources available and often already have a lot at their disposal.

Another link may be due to these parents being more likely to be involved in

their children’s education– which also has a strong correlation with student achievement.
