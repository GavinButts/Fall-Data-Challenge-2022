Summary: 

This source analyzes the efficiency and efficacy of different machine learning

algorithms under different circumstances. Machine learning is a field of study

that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

There are 8 primary types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised

learning, semi-supervised learning, reinforcement learning, multi-task learning,

ensemble learning, neural networks, and instance based learning. For smaller and

neatly classified data, you are likely to rely on a type of supervised machine

learning. Though they require less data, supervised learning algorithms are often

not as accurate as most other algorithms. Unsupervised learning, however, is

fantastic for dealing with large sets of data. They can yield very good results,

but this is contingent on having a large enough data set. Neural networks is an

algorithm modeled after the processes that occur in the brain. They require large

data sets but can be incredible at predicting results. The caveat to not using a

supervised learning algorithm is that they are often more difficult to code and

frequently have a high algorithmic complexity, some being NP-hard problems.
