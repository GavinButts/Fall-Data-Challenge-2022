Summary: 

This source discusses the ways school districts can approach programs to

increase parent and family involvement. They point out that involvement courses

do a lot for improving and increasing parent involvement. These programs need to

be conscious that the traditional family rarely exists anymore and that parents

that work are much less likely to interact with the school than their counterparts.
Each program at each school needs to be unique and tailored to the schools specific

policies and regulations. There are five types of parent involvement: basic parental

obligations like providing food and shelter, basic obligations of the school like

communicating about a child’s progress, parent involvement at school like working

in the classroom, parent involvement in learning activities at home like reviewing

class material, and parent involvement in governance and advocacy. A school program

should seek to achieve the improvement of school programs and classroom management,

the improvement of student learning and development, and the improvement of parents’

awareness of their continuing responsibilities and contributions to their children’s

education and development.
