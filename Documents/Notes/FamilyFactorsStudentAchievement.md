Summary: 

This source reviewed research findings with regard to family 

influences on student achievement. Of their reviews, they have five recurring findings: first, 

regardless of parents education level, ethnicity, or income level, parents want their 

children to be successful in school but do not know how to assist their children; second,

parent involvement pertains to involvement at home and at school, but more parents are able 

to participate at home; third, parents are more likely to be involved if they view their 

participation directly linked to the success of the child; fourth, school and teacher 

efforts to involve parents are more correlated to parent involvement than the parent’s 

education or income levels; fifth, shared responsibility for student learning is 

essential for all student success. The article concludes that high student performance 

can be attributed to realistic parental expectations of school performance, parent’s structure 

and support for learning in the home, positive emotional interactions between parents and 

children, authoritative parenting style, and parent involvement in the school and at home.
