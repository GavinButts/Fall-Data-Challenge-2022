Bohlmark, A., & Lindahl, M. (2007). The impact of school choice on pupil achievement, segregation and costs: Swedish evidence.

Summary: This source analizes school choice and its implications, as well as using a case study to gather data. Those advocating for school choice promote two major stances, that private schools are inherently better than public schools, and that competition between schools encourages each to improve their quality of education and to compete for pupils. On the other hand, those who oppose school choice acknowledge the potential benefits of choice but call to attention its effects on inequality. With the removal of good teachers, peers, and resources from the public sector, children of lower income and status are left in the desolate remains of public education. Using Sweden as a case study, the study found that, if private schools had 5% of pupils, doubling this would increase the average GPA by 9 percentile rank point. To address issues with inequality, they assessed the effect of school choice on immigrants. For this demographic, an increase of 10% in a private schoolâ€™s share of pupils results in an increase in average GPA by 0.8 percentile rank points
