Cooper, H., Robinson, J. C., & Patall, E. A. (2006). Does homework improve academic achievement? 
A synthesis of research, 1987–2003. Review of educational research, 76(1), 1-62.

Summary: 


This study took a look at the effects of homework on student success at different age levels. 

The correlation between homework and student achievement has been a topic of debate among 

education researchers. With a review on the effects of homework during 1987 and 2003, 

Copper et. al. agree that homework does little for student success in elementary aged children. 

They found a slight correlation with increased standardized test scores in middle school aged 

students who are given homework. High school students reap the largest benefit for homework of 

all age grounds. Copper et. al. found that homework, in most age groups, resulted in a better 

understanding of material, better study habits, greater self-discipline, parental interest in 

child’s academic progress, and much more. On the other hand, they found that homework results 

in a decreased interest in class material, physical and emotional fatigue, increased parental 

pressure, and increased rates of cheating.
